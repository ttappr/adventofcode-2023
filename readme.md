This project contains the solutions for all days of the puzzle challenge series.
All of them should be buildable/runnable after pulling them down to a target
system. 1 or 2 of them however may take some tweaking to get to work. 

For instance, Part 2 of Day 20 requires some a priori knowledge of which nodes
are connected to the final output node, and this may vary for each user. So,
you would have to update the code to work with your own puzzle input.

To read the puzzle instructions for each solution, you can browse the
[Advent of Code 2023 site](https://adventofcode.com/2023) calendar, click on the
day of interest.

Each project has a *readme.md* file. These are just the text of 
the **reddit** posts I made to the AoC 2023 
solutions threads as I completed each puzzle.
