# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This project contains the solutions for all days of the puzzle challenge series.
All of them should be buildable/runnable after pulling them down to a target
system. Except day 24 - this one relies on the Z3 solver library, which may 
take some steps to ensure that the compiler can locate the Z3 binaries. 

To read the challenge text for each solution, you'll need to browse to the
[Advent of Code 2023 site](https://adventofcode.com/2023) since, I believe,
we aren't permitted to include copies of our individual puzzle data or the
text to the problems in our posted projects.
